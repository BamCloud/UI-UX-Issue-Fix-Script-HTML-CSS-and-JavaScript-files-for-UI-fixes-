Resolving UI/UX Issues

Today, I focused on resolving UI/UX issues in CloudView. I helped the customer fix button misalignment, dropdown functionality, and made the platform responsive using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Troubleshooting UI/UX issues using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Making websites responsive with media queries
- Fixing interactive elements (buttons, modals, dropdowns)
- Documentation writing for internal support processes
